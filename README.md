# SQL_Covid-19-Data-Exploration
The above project is a Covid-19 data exploration exercise. It involves querying a database containing Covid-19 data, specifically focusing on cases, deaths, population, and vaccination information. The project utilizes various SQL skills such as joins, window functions, aggregate functions, and data type conversions.

The project begins by selecting and displaying the initial dataset, filtering out records where the continent is not specified. It then proceeds to analyze the data by calculating death percentages based on total cases and total deaths, giving insights into the likelihood of dying from Covid-19 in different locations.

The next step involves examining the percentage of the population infected with Covid-19 in the United States and identifying countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.

Additionally, the project analyzes countries with the highest death count per population, both globally and within each continent. It calculates the total cases, total deaths, and death percentage on a global level.

Finally, the project explores the relationship between total population and Covid-19 vaccinations, displaying the percentage of the population that has received at least one Covid vaccine. The data is presented for each location, continent, and date, including a rolling sum of new vaccinations.

Overall, the project provides insights into Covid-19 trends, such as death rates, infection rates, and vaccination progress, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the available data.
